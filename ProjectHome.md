It can create a history of the tracks played while offline and send them later in batch to Last.fm.

A beta 3 release (non signed) can be found [here](http://aspyplayer.googlecode.com/files/aspyplayer_beta3.sis). It has been tested only on **N95-1** device with python **1.4.2** installed. [Here](http://www.lastfm.com/group/Symbian+OS+Cell+Phones/forum/33921/_/247712/2#f5899326) there's a step-by-step tutorial on how to run it without signing. To sign the sis file, use the [Open Signed Online](https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do) service.

My posts about it in my blog are [here](http://dougfernando.blogspot.com/search/label/aspyplayer). Left a comment...

All kinds of feedback are welcome, it includes, bug reports, feature request, python patches, comments, etc.. Some [screenshots](screenshots.md)

I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I DONT PRETEND TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE ASPY PLAYER. I'M COMPLETELY FUCKED AT WORK, SO I DONT HAVE THE NECESSARY TIME TO WORK ON IT.

FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO USED THE ASPY PLAYER AND CONTRIBUTED WITH IT, I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE GREAT FEEDBACK THAT I GOT.

I RECOMMEND THE [MOBBLER](http://code.google.com/p/mobbler/) APP, WHICH IS JUST GREAT, I USE IT ALL THE TIME!

HOWEVER, I THINK THAT THE ASPY PLAYER IS A VERY GOOD SOURCE TO BE USED TO LEARN HOW TO CREATE APPLICATIONS IN PYS60. I THINK THAT THE QUALITY OF THE CODE IS HIGH.

IF SOMEONE WANT THE CODE TO CONTINUE THE PROJECT, PLEASE, CONTACT ME.
